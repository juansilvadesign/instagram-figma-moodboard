# Instagram Moodboard Capture — single-post MVP

One-click download of an Instagram post's media from a **logged-in Chrome profile**. An injected
button on each post saves its image, video, or full carousel to
`Downloads/instagram-captures/<username>-<shortcode>[-NN].<ext>`.

This is the **MVP** of the [Instagram → Figma moodboard idea](../../ideas/instagram-figma-moodboard.md)
— the v2 (capture a whole profile → auto-place into the Figma Instagram-UI template via
talk-to-figma) is spec'd there and gated on its B1 blocker. Working conventions + gotchas for
sessions in this repo: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Install (Windows Chrome, extension folder lives in WSL)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → `\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\jaypy\GitHub-Projects\Notes\ai-synthesizer\knowledge\projects\instagram-figma-moodboard\extension`
3. Open (or reload) an `instagram.com` tab. A download-arrow button appears in each post's action
   bar (next to Save); if the action bar isn't found, a dark round fallback button appears at the
   post's top-right.

After code changes: `chrome://extensions` → reload the extension → **reload the Instagram tab**
(required: the network tap that feeds carousel/sponsored downloads installs at page load).

## Use

Click the arrow on any post — feed, profile-grid modal, or `/p/…` / `/reel/…` permalink. A toast
reports progress and the saved file count. Carousels download every item, numbered `-01, -02, …`.
Videos save as progressive MP4 (audio included).

## Verify in Chrome (manual regression checklist)

This WSL env has no GUI Chrome, so the automated tests can't click the real page. A change counts
as **verified** when, in a logged-in Chrome:

- [ ] Feed **single image** post → 1 correctly-named `.jpg`/`.webp` in `Downloads/instagram-captures/`
- [ ] Feed **carousel** → all items land, `-01…-NN`, mixed image/video types correct
- [ ] **Video/Reel** post → `.mp4` that plays **with audio**
- [ ] **Reel with a music/audio attribution** (e.g. `/reel/DY_HBkqxebO/`) → saves the `.mp4`, not
      6 poster JPGs; console `shortcode=<realcode>` (never `audio`) and `resolved via network_cache`
- [ ] **Fullscreen Reels viewer** (`/reel/<code>/` vertical rail) → button appears IN the right-side
      rail, between Save and the "…" menu; survives scrolling to the next reel; icon is white and
      still shows when the post is already bookmarked (Save→Remove label flip must not hide it)
- [ ] **Profile grid → modal** → button present in the modal, download works
- [ ] **Permalink page** (`/p/<code>/`) → button present, download works
- [ ] **Feed carousel with deferred data, WARM tap** (open via feed → modal, e.g.
      `DYw5KdMDH6a`) → ALL N slides land via `network_cache` (or `embedded_json`)
- [ ] **Ad/sponsored carousel via DIRECT permalink, COLD tap** (paste `/p/DYw5KdMDH6a/` into a
      fresh tab, click) → ALL N slides still land; `[IGFM] media resolved via media_info` — the
      embedded cover lies (single image, `media_type 1`), so it's confirmed/completed from the
      media `pk` (v0.3.2 fix for the cold masked-carousel case)
- [ ] **Sponsored/ad post — carousel** → ALL slides land (any of `network_cache` /
      `embedded_json` / `ancestors:…`)
- [ ] Regular posts resolve in-page (instant) or fall back to `web_info`/`graphql` — check the
      `[IGFM] media resolved via …` console line; no click may freeze the page (>0.5 s jank);
      a partial download must SAY so in the toast (`N of M slides`)
- [ ] Button survives scrolling far down the feed and back (React re-renders)
- [ ] Service-worker console (`chrome://extensions` → Inspect views) shows `[IGFM]` trace, no errors

If the button lands in a weird spot or doesn't appear, grab the failing page's DOM context and fix
the heuristics in `content.js` (`findActionBar` / `postContainers`) — that's the expected drift
point, same as the twitter-video-downloader sibling.

## Automated tests (run in WSL)

```bash
node test/run-tests.cjs   # resolver + in-page engines (tap cache, payload scan, fiber walk)
                          # + the v2 placement manifest — 80 tests
node --check extension/*.js placement/*.cjs
```

## How it resolves media (short version)

Shortcode from the post's links (or the URL) → resolve inside the page (MAIN-world
`inject.js`): a fetch/XHR **tap cache** of the page's own feed/graphql responses (the only
place full carousel + sponsored data still exists client-side), then server-embedded JSON
blobs, then React fiber props. The in-page result seeds the escalation chain → fetch
`/p/<shortcode>/` and pick the richest embedded JSON across all blobs → if it still needs
completing, finish it from the media `pk` via `/api/v1/media/<pk>/info/` (Instagram's own REST
endpoint — no `doc_id` to rot). That last step is what covers a **cold direct-permalink ad
carousel**, whose embedded cover lies (advertises a single image) — so a lone image from an
untrusted source is confirmed by pk, while a trusted live-API single image is not → GraphQL
`doc_id` query → last-resort DOM `srcset` harvest (images only). Media URLs are direct CDN files
(signed), saved by the service worker via `chrome.downloads`. Details + failure modes:
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) → Architecture / Gotchas.

## v2 — profile → Figma moodboard

### Profile crawl (v0.4.0 — ⚠️ NOT yet verified in Chrome)

On a profile page a fixed **"Capture profile"** button appears (bottom-right). It scrolls the grid,
saves the most recent **24** posts' **covers** into `Downloads/instagram-captures/<handle>/`, and
writes a **`capture.json`** the placement engine reads. **Shift-click** to save every carousel
slide instead of covers only. Pacing is randomized 5–10s per post.

It makes almost no requests of its own: scrolling makes *Instagram's own page* fetch the post data,
which the extension's tap already caches — so media is read from the cache, and the only network
the tool performs is the downloads themselves.

**Profile-crawl checklist (run once in a real logged-in Chrome — none of this is Node-testable):**

- [ ] Button appears on `/<handle>/`, and **disappears** when you SPA-navigate to a post/feed
- [ ] Toast counts up (`Reading grid… n/24` → `Captured n of 24…`); ~2–4 min at 5–10s pacing
- [ ] `Downloads/instagram-captures/<handle>/` holds ~24 covers + `_avatar.jpg` + `capture.json`
- [ ] **Covers only** — a carousel contributes exactly ONE file, and a reel's file is a **`.jpg`
      poster, not an `.mp4`**
- [ ] `capture.json` → `posts[0]` is the **pinned** post if the grid shows one, with
      `"pinned": true`, and `posts[]` order matches the grid top-to-bottom
- [ ] `capture.json` → `profile.display_name` / `avatar_url` are populated (**unverified
      assumption**: that `media.user` carries `full_name`/`profile_pic_url`. If they're null, the
      crawl still works — the header just isn't captured)
- [ ] No file from a profile you didn't capture (gotcha #18 — the tap also caches suggested posts)
- [ ] **Shift-click** → every carousel slide lands, suffixed `-01…-NN`
- [ ] Re-running overwrites `capture.json` (not `capture (1).json`) — data: URL downloads are the
      likeliest thing to be blocked here; check the SW console if it's missing
- [ ] Then place it: `node placement/manifest.cjs /mnt/c/Users/<user>/Downloads/instagram-captures/<handle> --date <today>`

### Agent placement engine (built + live-verified 2026-07-17)

A capture folder becomes a dated Section holding a filled clone of the Figma IG-UI template:

```bash
node placement/manifest.cjs /mnt/c/Users/<user>/Downloads/instagram-captures --date 2026-07-17
```

…then the agent runs the MCP sequence in [`placement/PLACEMENT.md`](placement/PLACEMENT.md)
(needs the bun socket server + the **fork's** dev plugin). Posts are ordered newest-first by
decoding the shortcode to its media pk, capped at the template's 24 grid slots; a carousel places
its cover only; a video places an ffmpeg poster frame. No copy step — WSL reads the Windows
Downloads folder in place.

**Still open:** the **full-profile crawler** (nothing builds a multi-post folder automatically —
captures are hand-clicked for now) · `capture.json` feed order · the ▶ badge on video tiles ·
highlights · talk-to-figma server detection · stories/DMs (never).
